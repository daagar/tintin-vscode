# tintin-vscode
A simple grammar for TinTin++ files in Visual Studio Code

Based on the TextMate/SublimeText version at https://github.com/tintinplusplus/tintinplusplus-sublimetext

I highly suggest using a bracket colorizer as well, such as https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2

## Installation

Install via:
```code --install-extension TinTinPlusPlus-<version>.vsix```

# TinTin++
Be sure to keep up with the latest TinTin++ updates at: https://tintin.mudhalla.net/index.php

Thanks to Scandum for an excellent client!
