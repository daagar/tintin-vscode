A simple grammar for TinTin++ files in Visual Studio Code

Based on the TextMate/SublimeText version at https://github.com/tintinplusplus/tintinplusplus-sublimetext

I highly suggest using a bracket colorizer as well, such as https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2
